# drupal/recommended-project

The recommended method for creating Drupal sites as of 8.8.0 is to use the composer template at [`drupal/recommended-project`](https://github.com/drupal/recommended-project).

From Drupal 8.8, `drupal-composer/drupal-project` has been deprecated.

See [Using Composer to install Drupal and manage dependencies](https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/using-composer/using-composer-to-install-drupal-and-manage-dependencies) in the Drupal.org documentation.
