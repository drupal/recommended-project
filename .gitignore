# This file contains default .gitignore rules. To use it, copy it to .gitignore,
# and it will cause files like your settings.php and user-uploaded files to be
# excluded from Git version control. This is a common strategy to avoid
# accidentally including private information in public repositories and patch
# files.
#
# Because .gitignore can be specific to your site, this file has a different
# name; updating Drupal core will not override your custom .gitignore file.

# Ignore core when managing all of a project's dependencies with Composer

# Ignore dependencies that are managed with Composer.
# Generally you should only ignore the root vendor directory. It's important
# that core/assets/vendor and any other vendor directories within contrib or
# custom module, theme, etc., are not ignored unless you purposely do so.
